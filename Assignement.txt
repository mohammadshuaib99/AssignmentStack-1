Question 1} You have two stack and 1,2,3,4,5 values and you have pushed all these values to S1(in the order 1,2,3,4,5)
and then you took 2 element from top 
and and inserted into S2, then pop 1 element from s1,
and then take top of S2 and insert into S1. 
When is the second top element in S1;


Initial state:
S1 (top to bottom): 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
S2 (empty)

Move top 2 elements from S1 to S2:
S1: 3, 2, 1
S2: 5, 4

Pop 1 element from S1:
S1: 2, 1
S2: 5, 4

Take top of S2 (which is 4) and insert into S1:
S1: 4, 2, 1
S2: 5

Now, the second top element in S1 is 2.

Question 2} What does this function do?
1. Prints binary representation of n in reverse order.
2. Prints binary representation of n.
3. Print the value of Log n.
4.print the value of Log n in reverse order.

Answer : - The function is likely designed to print the binary
representation of a number 


Question 3} Which of the following statement about stack data structure is/are NOT Correct ?
1. Stack data structure can be implemented using linkedlist linkedlist
2. New Node can only be added at the top of the stack
3. Stack is the FIFO data structure.
4. Adding an element to a filled stack leads to underflow condition

Answer 3}:-----------
stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure,
3 option is incorrect.
